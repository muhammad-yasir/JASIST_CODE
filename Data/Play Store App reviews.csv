Did exactly what they instructed and still have tons of ads. Contacted support and didn't receive anything back. Stick to the free version and save your money because the premium is the same as the free as far as ads go.

Played one movie and it worked perfectly. Now it won't open any movies or shows. It starts to load then says no media playback in progress. Everything I have tried does not work. I've paid money to cast my online streaming. So basically feels like I've been conned out of my money. UPDATE: A couple days after this review its working better but stops playing films after 30 minutes.

About 90% of the time when I select a video, nothing happens, although the app says it's streaming. The remaining 10%, when I do actually manage to stream the video, it goes for 30 seconds or so and then Apple TV goes back to its home screen. No more playback. This app is useless for my purposes. A waste of $5. **EDIT: I got it to last 10 minutes, provided I turned on WakeLock and left the screen on, but then it crashed as before. You can't resume streaming unless you â€œstopâ€œ the stream and restart the app manually. The media is stored on the Nexus 10's internal storage, mp4 videos."

Sideways swiping 3 at a time is just downright annoying. This app is only useful to cast to my Chromecast. I don't bother trying to find new things to watch on here since it's such a pain. And now it seems to be lacking the option to go to the next episode after one ends.

The rep referred to a service script and told me it's a connection issue and to try and stream at a lower quality or on wifi. Tried that and the subtitles still won't work. The whole point of paying for the service and downloading the app is to access the service at a high quality on all my devices with all functions working. Netflix's job is to make sure their app works across platforms.

The movie format is MKV. **11/24 - It's located on my sd card in my tablet.

And the majority of my music is in Play Music so I'd need access to that; which this is supposedly capable of (and my stock N5 is rooted). No. It'll play the song for no more than 1 minute before appearing to disconnect from the AppleTV. I tried playing music that I had on my phone to the AppleTV, and it works until you pause the track. There's no unpausing the song so you'll have to start the song over or move on.. Really disappointing performance for a $5 app; you'd expect everything to work as claimed. At this point all this app does is stream local content to a Chromecast, which LocalCast does for free."
